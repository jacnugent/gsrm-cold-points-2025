# gsrm-cold-points-2025
Code used in Nugent et al., revised manuscript under review at _Earth and Space Science_ (original preprint [doi:10.22541/essoar.172405869.95851202/v1](https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.172405869.95851202/v1), August 2024), on the role of cold point-overshooting convection and lofting of cirrus near the cold point on influencing the height and temperature of the cold point tropopause in global storm-resolving models (GSRMs). 

Please note that relative and absolute file paths within the scripts and Jupyter notebooks listed below, as well as the names of files and directories, may have changed since they were last run. These scripts and notebooks therefore may not run "out of the box."

## Data Processing
(Pre)processing and preliminary analysis needed for the DYAMOND2 output, ERA5 reanalysis, and DARDAR observations.
### DYAMOND2
DYAMOND2 (winter phase) output can be accessed by contacting ESiWACE; see instructions [here](https://www.esiwace.eu/the-project/past-phases/dyamond-initiative). Full descriptions of the models and their outputs are provided by DKRZ [here](https://easy.gems.dkrz.de/DYAMOND/Winter/index.html).

In this study, the existing DYAMOND2 output from DKRZ was subset into 10째x10째 and/or 30째S - 10째N regions, then processed further for analysis:
* ...
### ERA5
* ...
### DARDAR
* ...

## Figures
# TODO: change so it points to notebook for plotting (not the figure) and only include data processing notes (no "plotted in")
# --> ALSO change figure names to "Fig1_xxx", etc.
Scripts needed to generate the figures used in the paper. Also includes processing of the QBO/ENSO index data and the IGRA sounding data.
